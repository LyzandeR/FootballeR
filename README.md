The application contains data from 11 countries:

# Details

FootballeR is split into 7 sections as depicted in the app's tabs:

- League Table
- Goals
- Results
- Over / Under
- Cards / Fouls
- Corners
- Raw Table

#### Sidebar

On the left hand side you can select the country, division and year you would like to view information about. You can also specify a date range to view stats for. Keep in mind that whenever you **change a choice on the sidebar, this will affect all of the tabs**.  


#### League Table

This tab shows information about the league table as it was according to your sidebar choices and between the dates specified at the slider on the sidebar. Try adjusting the date range slider to see how the league table was (or could have been) between different dates. (Notice that any date changes on the date slider will affect all of the tabs and not just the league table).

#### Goals 

This tab shows information about the goals and shots of each of the teams.

The first from the top graph shows the aggregated shots, shots on target and goals of each of the teams. Notice that for the first graph the orange line corresponds to the right y Axis whereas the bars correspond to the left y Axis. You can view information about:

- Home/Away/All games
- Total Shots and Goals or Per Game 

The second graph shows the individual performances of each of the teams. The games are in order as played i.e. the first game on the left is the oldest and the last game on the right is the most recent. You can select:

- The team of Interest 
- Home/Away/All Shots and Goals.

The funnel shows the total number of Shots, On Target Shots and Goals for the underlying league.

The bubble shows the average number of shots (total shots not shots on target) that in general teams need to take in order to score.

#### Results

This tab shows information about the results of each of the teams (Wins - Draws - Losses).

The first from the top graph shows the aggregated Wins, Draws and Losses of each of the teams. You can select between:

The next two graphs show the total number of League Wins and Draws for the underlying league for both Half Time and Full Time.

#### Cards / Fouls

This tab shows information about the Yellow and Red Cards of the league chosen and also contains information about the fouls commited.

The bottom left graph shows information about the referees of the league and the yellow and red cards they brandished.

The bottom right graph shows the total number of cards and fouls in the league selected.

#### Corners

The tab contains information about the corners of the selected league.

The first graph shows the aggregated corners per team. You can select:
